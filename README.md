# Chatterbox - A language learning app
Project by Grace Gustafson, Sri Satishkumar, Zaniah Kirkpatrick, and Gracie Driggers.
The purpose of this project is to create a language learning program. The program will support all languages, track the users progress, and ask them questions from a category to help them learn their chosen language. It will deliver these questions through games, like Fill in the Blank, Matching games, Flashcards, and Mock Conversations. It will be finished in 15 weeks at the end of the semester.
